Inspiration
I couldn't find a database of recommended plants for food forest community so I created one

What it does
A web-app to create/store/update/destroy a recommended plants to start a food forest for sustainable agriculture enthusiasts !

How I built it
Front end: html, thymeleaf Back end: mySQL, Spring boot using CRUD and MVC framework

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
You can search for plants based on multiple parameters in one search box (such as: which forest layer, seasonal type, name, tags...) I got to learn how to use Spring boot and Thymeleaf ! They are super fun !

What's next for F2DB-Food Forest Database
Hosting it online, implement add user, and add plant! More community events, news !

Built With
mysql
spring
thymeleaf
